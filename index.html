				Hello, welcome to my website! My name is David, but people on the internet call me Dejvoss. I'm a Czech
				student, and in my free time I enjoy coding. I sometimes make <a
					href="https://dejvoss.cz/games">games</a>
				and recently I started making websites, one example would be the <a
					href="https://omniarchive.net">Omniarchive</a> site.<br>
				For coding languages, I know C#, HTML and CSS somewhat good, then I know a bit of C++ and Java.<br>
				I make games with Unity, however I've experimented with creating a custom Java engine, so far it's very
				bare
				bones, can display models and has basic lighting. However I do plan on updating it.<br><br>

				If you wish to send me an e-mail for any reason, check out the <a
					href="https://dejvoss.cz/contact">contact</a> page. Be aware that my spam filter eats a lot of the
				mails! =D<br><br>

				I enjoy archiving things, thus I am a part of Omniarchive, a minecraft archiving server. I am also a
				part of
				<a href="https://theintraclinic.com">The Intra Clinic</a> , which archives games by Markus "Notch"
				Persson.
				(Also made the website).<br>
				Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DEJVOSS">my YouTube channel</a> for a showcase of stuff I
				have
				done. I plan on uploading footage of my tech demos and similar stuff there.<br><br>
				So far, that's all! Enjoy your stay!
